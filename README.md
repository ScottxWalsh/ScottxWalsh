- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScottxWalsh
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of philosophy and finance, which means I am fascinated with crypto.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I need to take my data analysis to the next level. I am versed in SQL, Excel, and a couple BI tools, like Looker and Dune Analytics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on crypto projects that empower those in the space as well as those entering the space.
- 📫 How to reach me -- email me at walsh@hey.com
